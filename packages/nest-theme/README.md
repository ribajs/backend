# Riba Nest THeme

This [Nest.js](https://nestjs.com/) module allows to use Riba.js Components to be rendered server-side (SSR) in your Nest.js application. In this way Riba can be used as a server-side template engine and custom elements can be pre-rendered. This means that the same framework can be used on the server side and on the client side. This way your source can be moved (or used) between both sides. This can also be useful for search engine optimization (SEO).

## Install

```sh
npm / yarn install @ribajs/nest-theme
```
